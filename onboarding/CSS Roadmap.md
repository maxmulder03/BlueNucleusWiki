# CSS Roadmap

*This is a quick roadmap for learning the fundamentals of CSS, tailwindcss, and how we'll be using it in the clinic. This doc is not comprehensive, but it should give you enough to be productive with CSS.*

**Tip:** CSS is very feature rich so it isn't feasible to read through the entire spec to understand everything. A lot of your learning will happen as you try to implement ideas you don't understand yet. Ask LLMs & refer to MDN docs as much as possible while you work!

## Roadmap 

### 1. CSS Layouts

The most fundamental building block of CSS is CSS Layouts. Learn how things are laid out on the page and the rest will come with experience and further research. Go through the following resources:

* [Intro to CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Introduction)
* [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
* [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

### 2. CSS Box Model (Padding, Margin, Borders)

Margin, padding and borders control the spacing around elements and how they will be perceived by the user in relation to other elements.

* [CSS Box Model (via w3)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)

### 3. Tailwind CSS

One important topic that this roadmap hasn't touched on is how vanilla CSS can be applied in a project. I've omitted this topic because we will be using tailwind which has a special way of applying css that's fairly different than most other CSS frameworks and traditional CSS.

**Extra Credit:** When it comes to any tools or frameworks like Tailwind, React, etc learning "why was this created & why is this popular?" can be a very efficient way to learning web development at a deeper level. All frameworks solve problems in reusable ways & impose opinionated methods that impact how we write software. I highly recommend researching this on your own time!
